# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
1. Generate 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes using NumPy, retrieve the nearest city for each pair using CitiPy, and perform an API call to OpenWeatherMap to retreive weather data for each of those cities.
2. Using the dataframe of randomly selected cities, create input statements to allow the customer to filter the cities down to ones that are within their max temperature range.  Find nearby hotels by using Google Maps Places API.
3. Create a travel itinerary by using for of the cities and Google Maps Directions API and include pop-up markers for each city.
